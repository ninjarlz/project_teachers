# De Haagse Onderwijsapp (codename - PROJECT: Teachers) 

This application was created as the project for European Project Semester.

Nowadays in the Hague, many teachers are leaving the education industry because of the weakened educational base. That means a new teacher has difficulty finding a way to communicate with a skilled teacher and to gain some helpful information. Therefore, we were asked by the client to create a mobile application called “De Haagse Onderwijsapp” - for both android & iOS - that aims to connect education professionals with selected coaches and within themselves. It must allow users to share their skills and learn competencies from others and it should focus on accessibility and interaction between teachers and certified coaches. That way, for the former, the way of learning competencies can be as efficient as possible.

According to our client’s requirements one of the most crucial challenges of the twenty-first century is the following issue - how can we improve the learning process of our children in the era of ubiquitous digitization? There are many possible answers to that question, and our client came up with one of them - a mobile application providing matchmaking service for educational professionals. Such a platform is meant to deliver an unprecedented dose of flexibility for them, everyone would be able to find guidance from both regular users and ‘coaches’ (easily accessible and well-trained individuals, which will be selected for this role by our client). Our team is sure that this revolutionary solution can successfully introduce the concept of sharing economy (also known as collaborative consumption) to a quite ossified educational system. The final product will give the possibility to every educational professional in the Netherlands to share their knowledge and experience in a peer-to-peer fashion. According to the concept presented by the client, each user will have the opportunity to search for any specific kind of knowledge in two ways:
* By establishing communication with the coach or other educational professionals based on the set of specific filters.
* Via a timeline that gives educational professionals the opportunity to interact, ask questions, reply and search for specific subjects.
